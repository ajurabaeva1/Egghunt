## Project Description
The name of my game is "Egg Hunt". The main idea of this game is to eat the egg and don't hit the wall within 25 seconds.

### MVP/PostMVP - 5min

The functionality will then be divided into two separate lists: MPV and PostMVP.  Carefully decided what is placed into your MVP as the client will expect this functionality to be implemented upon project completion.  

#### MVP 
- Create a welcoming page .
- Create an object.
- Get object to move around using the keyboard.
- Object hits the wall and game over.
- Create an egg.
- Object eats the egg and gets a point.
- Egg dissapears.
- Make eggs appear randomly.
- Make the score board change after each egg. 
- The Game will be over once the timer (25seconds) is up => "You Win".


#### PostMVP 

- Style.
- Add animations.
- Add Levels.


### Landing Page
Welcome Page

### Game Initialization


### Playing The Game 
To play the game user has to move the object around using the keyboard.
### Winning The Game
To win the game user has to try not to hit the wall within 25 seconds while catching eggs.

### Resetting The Game
Once the game is over, the alert message comes out and gives you the option of replaying the game.

Time frames are also key in the development cycle.  You have limited time to code all phases of the game.  Your estimates can then be used to evalute game possibilities based on time needed and the actual time you have before game must be submitted. It's always best to pad the time by a few hours so that you account for the unknown so add and additional hour or two to each component to play it safe.

## Helper Functions
(Num/50)*50 – let me position my egg exactly inside the cells while moving randomly.
$scorebox.innerHTML= ' ' – let me put a timer


## Additional Libraries
W3 Schools
MDN


## Change Log
The idea of the classic snake game helped to come up with my own game. I changed it to the way where my player chases the egg and gets a point without growing its body. 


## Issues and Resolutions
 - My object wasn't moving in the right direction. (misspelled the word)
-The egg wasn’t positioning itself exactly inside the cell after using Math.random(). ( applied this formula to make it work (Num/50)*50) src=stackoverflow
